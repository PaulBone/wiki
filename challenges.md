# Challenges for your PL
Make sure your programming language is well-rounded by performing some of these tasks in your PL.

## Starting
* Sum ASCII numbers from a file or stdin
* Operations on lines in a file or stdin:
  * Count
  * Reverse
  * Sort
* Counting occurrences of:
  * Characters
  * Words
* Substitute a given string with another
* Count occurrences of a given string (`grep -c`)
* Output transitive closure of a graph e.g.  
    INPUT: a -> b, b -> c  
    OUTPUT: a -> b, **a -> c**, b -> c  
* Topological sort
* {Bubble, insertion, quick, merge} sort
* Numeric algorithms
  * Fibonacci
  * Factorial
  * pi
  * Calculate [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor#Using_Euclid's_algorithm)
  * [Exponentiation by squaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring)

## Intermediate
* Game of Life

## Domain Specific
* Graphical User Interfaces
  * [7 GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/)

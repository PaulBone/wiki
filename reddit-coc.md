# Code of conduct
## Inclusion statement

This community brings together people from all over the world
interested in exploring the nature of programming languages.
We have many different backgrounds and past experiences,
and these differences are valuable, helping us find solutions
that weren’t apparent if we were working alone.

We are committed to providing a safe and friendly environment for anyone,
regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
age, religion, nationality, relationship status
or any other similar characteristic.

## Rules for conduct
1. Discussion should stay on topic.

   We are a community dedicated to the discussion of programming language design,
   so discussion should remain related to this topic.
   Keep subreddit posts and comments and IRC messages related
   to programming language design. Use the appropriate Discord channel,
   and do not use the off-topic channels for unwanted promotional or NSFW material.

2. Be civil and respectful

   While we encourage discussion, and yes, even disagreements,
   we require them to remain civil, respectful, and constructive.
   We don’t want you here if your behavior disrupts the community.
   Examples of disruptive behaviors include, but are not limited to:
   insults, threats, intimidation, discrimination, personal attacks,
   harassment, rudeness, doxing, excessive negativity, spamming, trolling,
   excessive melodrama, and sexualized attention. 

## Remedy
Please bring any conduct violations to the attention of the moderators.
For smaller infractions, such as off-topic or excessively rude posts,
moderators will begin by issuing a warning to promptly cease the problematic behavior.
Failing compliance, moderators reserve the right to ban the offending person
from the community for some period of time, with the hope the individual returns
ready and able to behave appropriately.
In extreme situations, a permanent ban may be issued.

Moderators have full discretion to interpret behavior according to these rules,
taking into account the best interest of the overall community.
Moderators work together to ensure resolutions are fair and consistent.

You may 
[contact the moderators via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FProgrammingLanguages),
or PM any moderator on IRC or Discord.
Please take up issues in private (e.g. modmail) first,
as to avoid unnecessary drama or controversy.

The moderators are not exempt from these rules.
In the event of moderator abuse, please contact another moderator, such as /u/slavfox.
